    <h2 style="font-size: 30px"> Project Idea: 'Hobbi' (The Hobby Companion App)</h2>
</header>

<main>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>This project proposes a mobile application, 'Hobbi', that allows people to keep track of all the hobbies/activities they undertake in their life. The app will allow users to log and rate their activities, set and track goals specific to their activities, as well as note down tips and tricks learnt to aid users when revisiting a hobby. The app will also have a section for users to explore new hobbies they are yet to have tried and provide some short advice/information to aid their commencement of said hobby.</p>
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>I consider myself a hobby enthusiast who one day can look back knowing I have tried as many things life has to offer. In this quest for fun I have had a large tendency to end up moving on from a specific hobby/activity, too intimidated to revisit it because I have forgotten where I last left off and feel the burden of having to relearn or start from scratch. I feel that too many people I have met are afraid of trying new things or feel unlucky they were not born into a certain activity growing up and I hope this app can change that and motivate people to stick with something or to not be afraid of picking something up.
  For myself this app would also come in handy for when I feel like I have nothing to do and hopefully will get people doing things and feel as if they are working towards or achieving something (rather than lounging around all day), which is aided by the apps ability to suggest new activities people may have never tried before.</p>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>As mentioned earlier the application will have numerous uses that will be divided into separate tabs that will be displayed across the bottom of the mobile application screen in a row, these are; My Hobbies (main page), Explore new Hobbies and a settings tab.</p>
    <h4><em>'My Hobbies' tab</em></h4>
    <p>When the app is opened the ‘My hobbies’ mainpage will be displayed and list all hobbies that have been logged/undertaken. These will be listed  in order of ‘most to least recent’ however will have an option to mark specific hobbies as ‘favourites’ will will be pinned to the top of the list, in addition to other list filtering options (eg. alphabetical).
  For first time users, there will be an option to browse and add either hobbies on the list or to add your own. Upon selecting/adding a hobby to your ‘hobby list’ you will find yourself within the specific page for that hobby. Here users will be able to see more information about the specific hobby (how to start, difficulty, price, web links, etc.) and its overall rating (community or individual rating). More importantly under the page heading people will be able to ‘add a session’ after they have actually gone and participated in said hobby session and record session enjoyment, what they achieved, what they learnt, tips and tricks, session time, location, goal for next session and even have the option to add a photo. This will be added as a private post within that hobby section as reference in the future. On specific hobby pages users will also have the option to set long term  goals/purposes to further motivate themselves.</p>
    <h4><em>'Explore Hobbies' tab </em></h4>
    <p>As for other features found in the menu tabs across the bottom of the screen, the ‘Explore tab’ will open to a large scrollable list of possible suggestions of things to try and by clicking on one will present a page just like that of those in the ‘my hobbies’ tab. This list may also be categorically divided into sections (e.g Sports, At-home, Miscellaneous, etc.) and like that of my hobbies can also be filtered in numerous ways.</p>
    <h4><em>Other Tabs</em></h4>
    <p>The final tab of the app is a ‘more’ tab which includes app settings, app/developer details, general app info, and also a feedback link that will allow users to send in any recommendations, or issues they are having with the application.</p>
    <h4><em>Colour Theme / Design / Logo</em></h4>
    <p>The app will keep a consistent colour palette that will make its pages distinct and unique. Whilst this is still being decided upon the colour theme, design and logo of the app will aim to be neat and inviting to users.</p>

    <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
    <p>For making a mobile application there are two main ways of achieving this.
  The first option requires learning how to code using a programming language (e.g Javascript, python) and inputting that code onto an IDE (integrated Development Environment) (eg. android studio). I would then work on creating both back-end code and front-end code, as well as implementing CSS to develop the application.
  Alternatively, today there exists many no-code app builders that use modules in a drag and drop system to create your app (eg. Flutterflow, Bubble). Whilst this method of app development is a lot easier and more intuitive than the former, this method normally restricts a lot of creativity, capability and normally requires users to pay a premium for its services.
  You will also require an Emulator to run your code on your computer to test it, followed by a mobile device itself to run the app as intended.</p>

    <h3>Skills Required</h3>
    <p>As mentioned earlier, if I am going to code the application myself the biggest challenge will be in actually learning how to code at a suitable level with a certain programming language. The quality of the application and its success will predominantly come down to the quality of my coding. Given the fact that other software such as IDE’s and Emulators can be found free of charge should not be a limiting factor to achieve this project. Regarding hardware I will require a computer to write the code and test the application as well as a mobile device to conduct further tests, all of which I already possess.</p>

    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <p>I believe in developing this application other like minded people who want to make the most out of what life has to offer will find this companion app very useful in motivating them to try something new, or pick up activities they have abandoned. I hope as a wider result that this application will improve the mental health of users by helping them find the thing that brings them joy and help them stick with it, which we all know can get hard with the many distractions and responsibilities that life brings.</p>
