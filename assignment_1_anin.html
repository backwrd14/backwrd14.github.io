        <h2> Interest in IT </h2>
          <p>Whilst it may not seem so through my studies/career prospects, IT has always had quite a large impact on my life and is a field I am consistently interested in. My earliest memories that sparked my interest in IT stem from my fond memories of playing crash bandicoot on my original Xbox console. Gaming soon became a big part of my early life and followed me throughout as I would eagerly await newer generation consoles. I also always felt connected to IT and how computers and all my other electronic devices worked. Around high school is when my love for gaming and all things IT started to fade and my interests moved elsewhere with my friend groups. Since, I have kept my interest to IT to myself and in my own time dabbled in things such as video editing, music production, gaming (again), PC building and so on. </p>

          <p>Given this personal interest in IT, in addition to the growing IT sector and its growing relevance in today's world (in almost every way) I thought I would take 'introduction to IT' to re-explore this interest with hopes that the skills and broad knowledge I acquire from this introductory course will better inform me for my personal life, equip me with desired skills that for my career and also give me an understanding and insight into the industry in general - with hopes of one day pursuing this field in the future (or at least have some sort of edge). </p>

          <p>During my studies I hope to learn more about the specific fields/pathways that IT has to offer along with acquiring some practical skills such as basic coding, web development, etc. I also believe that a broader understanding of the importance and ways in which IT effects our lives will give me a greater overall understanding and appreciation of IT, open up more opportunities in the future with my new knowledge/skills, and give me more confidence in pursuing these opportunities.</p>

        <h3> Job Decription</h3>
        <p>Given my studies and past experience I am not looking for a job specifically in the IT field per se. My ideal career would to be to work for one of the big non-for-profit NGO's that work within the development sector. The job position above falls amongst this interest having chosen the 'United Nations' World Food Programme (WFP)' - which is the largest program that aims to save and improve lives through ensuring better food security for all. Given my previous working experience in supply chain and logistics I specifically chose the role of a supply chain officer thereby combining my skills and interests in the one job.</p>
        <h3> Skills Required</h3>
        <p>Skills required for this role will include leadership, problem solving, interpersonal skills, teamwork, supply chain operations knowledge and understanding and adequate use of logistics specific programs aswell as management of lots of database systems and data analysis. The role requires a degree in a relevant field (specifically mentioning International development), 8 years of international humanitarian development focused logistics,
Also requirees french but ultimately I would want to await for a role like this to become available in Australia, Vietnam, Indonesia to which I already have language proficiency in.</p>
        <h3> My Current Skills</h3>
          <ul>
            <li> Supply chain and logisitcs knowledge and experience</li>
            <li>Leadership experience</li>
            <li>Teamwork</li>
            <li>Multi-lingual</li>
            <li>Academic specialisation in Humanitarian Development </li>
            <li> Strong interpersonal skills</li>
          </ul>
        <h3> Plan to Develop Required Skills</h3>
        <p>I feel that of the required skills mentioned I have a small amount of expeirence with each. I hope overtime I willl continue to push myself, through work, university, extracirricular activities and my general personal life to keep improving upon these skills to a point in which I will be suitable for the job. What I donâ€™t have any experience with is in regards to the final two skills of analysing data and databases but hopefully through this course and personal learning I could develop these skills.</p>

        <h3> Test 1: Myers-Briggs Test</h3>

        <h3> Test 2: Learning Style Test</h3>
        <img src="Learning Style.png" alt="Learning Style Test Results" width"500" height="500">
        <h3> Test 3: Leadership Style Test</h3>
        <img src="Leadership Style.png" alt="Leadership Style Test Results" width"500" height="500">

        <h3> Interpretation of Results</h3>
        <p> These tests gave a very interesting insight into some aspects of myself I had not yet considered. The  Myers-Briggs test I found especially resonated with a lot with my own personal outlooks on life and my held values/beliefs. It explained how I can be an effective leader given my pursuit to do what is wright and go out of my way to help others and try make the world a better place. However, along with this this personality type it depicts as also being prone to being unrealistic, overly empathetic and at times too straight forward. Given this alluded to a sense of leadership I decided to take a separate online test to gauge my leadership style finding that I border on being a democratic/participative and a laissez faire style leader. As for my learning style the test considered me a visual learner to which I definitely agree with. </p>
        <p>In all, these results tell me that I a passionate and reliable person who is capable of leading a team but with a tendency to do so in a more relaxed cooperative manner who takes on information visually and by doing.</p>
        <p>I think with these results I will be more aware of my weaknesses and strengths and use this information in a way so that I can best contribute to the team.</p>
        <p>When forming a team I think it is important to get people who may have strengths different to my own so that we can have a well-rounded team. </p>
