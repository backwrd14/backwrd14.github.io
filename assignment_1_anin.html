        <h2> Interest in IT </h2>
          <p>Whilst it may not seem so through my studies/career prospects, IT has always had quite a large impact on my life and is a field I am consistently interested in. My earliest memories that sparked my interest in IT stem from my fond memories of playing crash bandicoot on my original Xbox console. Gaming soon became a big part of my early life and followed me throughout as I would eagerly await newer generation consoles. I also always felt connected to IT and how computers and all my other electronic devices worked. Around high school is when my love for gaming and all things IT started to fade and my interests moved elsewhere with my friend groups. Since, I have kept my interest to IT to myself and in my own time dabbled in things such as video editing, music production, gaming (again), PC building and so on. </p>

          <p>Given this personal interest in IT, in addition to the growing IT sector and its growing relevance in today's world (in almost every way) I thought I would take 'introduction to IT' to re-explore this interest with hopes that the skills and broad knowledge I acquire from this introductory course will better inform me for my personal life, equip me with desired skills that for my career and also give me an understanding and insight into the industry in general - with hopes of one day pursuing this field in the future (or at least have some sort of edge). </p>

          <p>During my studies I hope to learn more about the specific fields/pathways that IT has to offer along with acquiring some practical skills such as basic coding, web development, etc. I also believe that a broader understanding of the importance and ways in which IT effects our lives will give me a greater overall understanding and appreciation of IT, open up more opportunities in the future with my new knowledge/skills, and give me more confidence in pursuing these opportunities.</p>
