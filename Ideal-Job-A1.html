  <h3> Job Decription</h3>
  <p>Given my studies and past experience I am not looking for a job specifically in the IT field per se. My ideal career would to be to work for one of the big non-for-profit NGO's that work within the development sector. The job position above falls amongst this interest having chosen the 'United Nations' World Food Programme (WFP)' - which is the largest program that aims to save and improve lives through ensuring better food security for all. Given my previous working experience in supply chain and logistics I specifically chose the role of a supply chain officer thereby combining my skills and interests in the one job.</p>
  <h3> Skills Required</h3>
  <p>Skills required for this role will include leadership, problem solving, interpersonal skills, teamwork, supply chain operations knowledge and understanding and adequate use of logistics specific programs aswell as management of lots of database systems and data analysis. The role requires a degree in a relevant field (specifically mentioning International development), 8 years of international humanitarian development focused logistics,
Also requirees french but ultimately I would want to await for a role like this to become available in Australia, Vietnam, Indonesia to which I already have language proficiency in.</p>
  <h3> My Current Skills</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Supply chain and logisitcs knowledge and experience</li>
      <li>Leadership experience</li>
      <li>Teamwork</li>
      <li>Multi-lingual</li>
      <li>Academic specialisation in Humanitarian Development </li>
      <li> Strong interpersonal skills</li>
    </ul>
  <h3> Plan to Develop Required Skills</h3>
  <p>I feel that of the required skills mentioned I have a small amount of expeirence with each. I hope overtime I willl continue to push myself, through work, university, extracirricular activities and my general personal life to keep improving upon these skills to a point in which I will be suitable for the job. What I donâ€™t have any experience with is in regards to the final two skills of analysing data and databases but hopefully through this course and personal learning I could develop these skills.</p>
