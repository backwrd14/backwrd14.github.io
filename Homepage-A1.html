        <h2> Interest in IT </h2>
          <p>Whilst it may not seem so through my studies/career prospects, IT has always had quite a large impact on my life and is a field I am consistently interested in. My earliest memories that sparked my interest in IT stem from my fond memories of playing crash bandicoot on my original Xbox console. Gaming soon became a big part of my early life and followed me throughout as I would eagerly await newer generation consoles. I also always felt connected to IT and how computers and all my other electronic devices worked. Around high school is when my love for gaming and all things IT started to fade and my interests moved elsewhere with my friend groups. Since, I have kept my interest to IT to myself and in my own time dabbled in things such as video editing, music production, gaming (again), PC building and so on. </p>

          <p>Given this personal interest in IT, in addition to the growing IT sector and its growing relevance in today's world (in almost every way) I thought I would take 'introduction to IT' to re-explore this interest with hopes that the skills and broad knowledge I acquire from this introductory course will better inform me for my personal life, equip me with desired skills that for my career and also give me an understanding and insight into the industry in general - with hopes of one day pursuing this field in the future (or at least have some sort of edge). </p>

          <p>During my studies I hope to learn more about the specific fields/pathways that IT has to offer along with acquiring some practical skills such as basic coding, web development, etc. I also believe that a broader understanding of the importance and ways in which IT effects our lives will give me a greater overall understanding and appreciation of IT, open up more opportunities in the future with my new knowledge/skills, and give me more confidence in pursuing these opportunities.</p>

        <h3> Job Decription</h3>
        <p>Given my studies and past experience I am not looking for a job specifically in the IT field per se. My ideal career would to be to work for one of the big non-for-profit NGO's that work within the development sector. The job position above falls amongst this interest having chosen the 'United Nations' World Food Programme (WFP)' - which is the largest program that aims to save and improve lives through ensuring better food security for all. Given my previous working experience in supply chain and logistics I specifically chose the role of a supply chain officer thereby combining my skills and interests in the one job.</p>
        <h3> Skills Required</h3>
        <p>Skills required for this role will include leadership, problem solving, interpersonal skills, teamwork, supply chain operations knowledge and understanding and adequate use of logistics specific programs aswell as management of lots of database systems and data analysis. The role requires a degree in a relevant field (specifically mentioning International development), 8 years of international humanitarian development focused logistics,
Also requirees french but ultimately I would want to await for a role like this to become available in Australia, Vietnam, Indonesia to which I already have language proficiency in.</p>
        <h3> My Current Skills</h3>
          <ul>
            <li> Supply chain and logisitcs knowledge and experience</li>
            <li>Leadership experience</li>
            <li>Teamwork</li>
            <li>Multi-lingual</li>
            <li>Academic specialisation in Humanitarian Development </li>
            <li> Strong interpersonal skills</li>
          </ul>
        <h3> Plan to Develop Required Skills</h3>
        <p>I feel that of the required skills mentioned I have a small amount of expeirence with each. I hope overtime I willl continue to push myself, through work, university, extracirricular activities and my general personal life to keep improving upon these skills to a point in which I will be suitable for the job. What I don’t have any experience with is in regards to the final two skills of analysing data and databases but hopefully through this course and personal learning I could develop these skills.</p>

        <h3> Test 1: Myers-Briggs Test</h3>

        <h3> Test 2: Learning Style Test</h3>

        <h3> Test 3: Leadership Style Test</h3>
        <img src="Leadership Style.png" alt="Leadership Style Test Results" width"500" height="500">

        <h3> Interpretation of Results</h3>
        <p> These tests gave a very interesting insight into some aspects of myself I had not yet considered. The  Myers-Briggs test I found especially resonated with a lot with my own personal outlooks on life and my held values/beliefs. It explained how I can be an effective leader given my pursuit to do what is wright and go out of my way to help others and try make the world a better place. However, along with this this personality type it depicts as also being prone to being unrealistic, overly empathetic and at times too straight forward. Given this alluded to a sense of leadership I decided to take a separate online test to gauge my leadership style finding that I border on being a democratic/participative and a laissez faire style leader. As for my learning style the test considered me a visual learner to which I definitely agree with. </p>
        <p>In all, these results tell me that I a passionate and reliable person who is capable of leading a team but with a tendency to do so in a more relaxed cooperative manner who takes on information visually and by doing.</p>
        <p>I think with these results I will be more aware of my weaknesses and strengths and use this information in a way so that I can best contribute to the team.</p>
        <p>When forming a team I think it is important to get people who may have strengths different to my own so that we can have a well-rounded team. </p>

        <h2> Project Idea: 'Hobbi' (The Hobby Companion App)</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>This project proposes a mobile application, 'Hobbi', that allows people to keep track of all the hobbies/activities they undertake in their life. The app will allow users to log and rate their activities, set and track goals specific to their activities, as well as note down tips and tricks learnt to aid users when revisiting a hobby. The app will also have a section for users to explore new hobbies they are yet to have tried and provide some short advice/information to aid their commencement of said hobby.</p>
        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>I consider myself a hobby enthusiast who one day can look back knowing I have tried as many things life has to offer. In this quest for fun I have had a large tendency to end up moving on from a specific hobby/activity, too intimidated to revisit it because I have forgotten where I last left off and feel the burden of having to relearn or start from scratch. I feel that too many people I have met are afraid of trying new things or feel unlucky they were not born into a certain activity growing up and I hope this app can change that and motivate people to stick with something or to not be afraid of picking something up.
For myself this app would also come in handy for when I feel like I have nothing to do and hopefully will get people doing things and feel as if they are working towards or achieving something (rather than lounging around all day), which is aided by the apps ability to suggest new activities people may have never tried before.</p>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>As mentioned earlier the application will have numerous uses that will be divided into separate tabs that will be displayed across the bottom of the mobile application screen in a row, these are; My Hobbies (main page), Explore new Hobbies and a settings tab.</p>
        <h4><em>'My Hobbies' tab</em></h4>
        <p>When the app is opened the ‘My hobbies’ mainpage will be displayed and list all hobbies that have been logged/undertaken. These will be listed  in order of ‘most to least recent’ however will have an option to mark specific hobbies as ‘favourites’ will will be pinned to the top of the list, in addition to other list filtering options (eg. alphabetical).
For first time users, there will be an option to browse and add either hobbies on the list or to add your own. Upon selecting/adding a hobby to your ‘hobby list’ you will find yourself within the specific page for that hobby. Here users will be able to see more information about the specific hobby (how to start, difficulty, price, web links, etc.) and its overall rating (community or individual rating). More importantly under the page heading people will be able to ‘add a session’ after they have actually gone and participated in said hobby session and record session enjoyment, what they achieved, what they learnt, tips and tricks, session time, location, goal for next session and even have the option to add a photo. This will be added as a private post within that hobby section as reference in the future. On specific hobby pages users will also have the option to set long term  goals/purposes to further motivate themselves.</p>
        <h4><em>'Explore Hobbies' tab </em></h4>
        <p>As for other features found in the menu tabs across the bottom of the screen, the ‘Explore tab’ will open to a large scrollable list of possible suggestions of things to try and by clicking on one will present a page just like that of those in the ‘my hobbies’ tab. This list may also be categorically divided into sections (e.g Sports, At-home, Miscellaneous, etc.) and like that of my hobbies can also be filtered in numerous ways.</p>
        <h4><em>Other Tabs</em></h4>
        <p>The final tab of the app is a ‘more’ tab which includes app settings, app/developer details, general app info, and also a feedback link that will allow users to send in any recommendations, or issues they are having with the application.</p>
        <h4><em>Colour Theme / Design / Logo</em></h4>
        <p>The app will keep a consistent colour palette that will make its pages distinct and unique. Whilst this is still being decided upon the colour theme, design and logo of the app will aim to be neat and inviting to users.</p>

        <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
        <p>For making a mobile application there are two main ways of achieving this.
The first option requires learning how to code using a programming language (e.g Javascript, python) and inputting that code onto an IDE (integrated Development Environment) (eg. android studio). I would then work on creating both back-end code and front-end code, as well as implementing CSS to develop the application.
Alternatively, today there exists many no-code app builders that use modules in a drag and drop system to create your app (eg. Flutterflow, Bubble). Whilst this method of app development is a lot easier and more intuitive than the former, this method normally restricts a lot of creativity, capability and normally requires users to pay a premium for its services.
You will also require an Emulator to run your code on your computer to test it, followed by a mobile device itself to run the app as intended.</p>

        <h3>Skills Required</h3>
        <p>As mentioned earlier, if I am going to code the application myself the biggest challenge will be in actually learning how to code at a suitable level with a certain programming language. The quality of the application and its success will predominantly come down to the quality of my coding. Given the fact that other software such as IDE’s and Emulators can be found free of charge should not be a limiting factor to achieve this project. Regarding hardware I will require a computer to write the code and test the application as well as a mobile device to conduct further tests, all of which I already possess.</p>

        <h3>Outcome</h3>
        <p>I believe in developing this application other like minded people who want to make the most out of what life has to offer will find this companion app very useful in motivating them to try something new, or pick up activities they have abandoned. I hope as a wider result that this application will improve the mental health of users by helping them find the thing that brings them joy and help them stick with it, which we all know can get hard with the many distractions and responsibilities that life brings.</p>
